# Sell Behat tests to your boss or clients

- __Speaker__: Anka Bajurin Stiskalov
- __Duration__: ~25 min

## Description

When ever I read or talk about writing tests it seams that the biggest problem is of a financial nature. How will I write unit tests, acceptance tests, functional tests or any tests when the budget is small and deadline is tight.
Or why should we care when client or boss doesn’t care?
Behat tests seams to me the most easier to sell and I like to share that opinion with you.


## Speaker short bio

I’m PHP and Symfony developer. Mother of 4 little “angels”. Working for Q for 4 years now.
I have started 13 years ago as an Actionscript developer, developing small games, CD presentations and 3D websites in Papervision and Flash.
PHP was my backend side for my Actionscript apps so I have easily transferred when the time was to move on.
I like Symfony very much but the last year I have spent as a pure PHP developer and team lead on a News UK projects.
