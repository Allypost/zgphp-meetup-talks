# Strangler pattern basics

- __Speaker__: Ivan Herak
- __Duration__: ~20min

## Description

When approaching legacy code, we are often faced with a complicated application which we feel would be best to rewrite completely. However, this task can be time-consuming and with questionable outcome.

Enter Strangler Pattern!

Even though it is often combined with migration to microservices, I will also provide some more down-to-earth examples on how to use this pattern within your application.
