# Acceptance criteria 101

- __Speaker__: Vedran "Brko" Krizek
- __Duration__: 30 min

## Description

Writing acceptance kriteria is not hard, unfortunately writing bad acceptance criteria is even easier. Without knowing the really basic details, the outcome is often mainly due to a chance and individual talent.
Since we shouldn't really rely on chance, and since we not all super-talented, the alternative to "just wing it" is to understand what acceptance criteria really are and that they are extremely simple things when all the layers of fancy terms and philosophy are removed.

The talk is based upon the blog post I've written a few weeks ago which can be read here: https://blog.trikoder.net/acceptance-criteria-demystified-48a817c2f9ca
