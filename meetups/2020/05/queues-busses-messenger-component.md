# Queues, busses and the Messenger Component

- __Speaker__: Tobias Nyholm
- __Duration__: 35 - 45min (Depending on what you want)

## Description

Message queues are the perfect way to decentralize your application. You may use
them for communication, scheduling and decentralization of your application. With
help from a message queue you may decouple your application from the framework and
the infrastructure. Which means that your app is written in pure PHP and not
Symfony/Laravel/Yii etc.

With some smart configuration on your message bus you may put the message queue
outside of your application and you may leverage from a decentralized and asynchronous
system.

This talk will quickly go throw the basics of queues, hexagonal design and show
proof of concept with Symfonyâ€™s Messenger component.
