# Dropping ACID - Schema Design for e-commerce

- __Speaker__: Andreas Braun
- __Duration__: 45 min

## Description

When designing a schema for e-commerce applications, we have to keep certain things in mind: data retention rules require duplicating large chunks of data, leading to complex schemas in any relational database. Modern database systems can help us solve this problem, but we seldom use their features when designing schemas. In this talk, we will take a look at some strategies on how to design more efficient schemas for certain database systems, and how to effectively drop ACID at work.
