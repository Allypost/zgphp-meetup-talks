# Get, set.. STOP

- __Speaker__: Zvonimir Spajic
- __Duration__: 30 min

## Description

Wikipedia defines Cargo cult programming as "Ritual inclusion of code or program structures that serve no real purpose."

One behaviour, deeply embedded into the hearts and minds of many software developers is the creation of getters and setter on entities. It' so widespread that IDEs have tools to do it automatically.

Why do we do it? Does it serve some purpose or is it just a cargo cult programming ritual?
