# Domain-Driven Design Techniques For Everyone

- __Speaker__: Nick Tune
- __Duration__: 60 min

## Description

Domain-Driven Design is an approach to software development that encourages the whole team to understand the domain so that the quality of the software and the quality of the product are better.

In this session, you will learn practical techniques and just enough theory to begin applying the different aspects of Domain-Driven Design:

- Collaborative Discovery (technical and domain experts modelling together)

- Strategic Design (architectural-level domain alignment)

- Tactical (coding patterns)

You'll be able to begin using these techniques immediately, and you'll learn how to choose the most appropriate tools for the type of project you are working on and situation you are in.

This session will involve a short DDD exercise on a virtual whiteboard. So if you have the time, please spend a few minutes learning the basic controls of [Miro](https://miro.com) (you can sign up for free, and it's recommended to download the desktop app).

## Speaker short bio

Hi, I'm Nick Tune. I get excited about solving problems in the best way possible. I like Domain-Driven Design because it encourages me to think about all aspects of a problem: business, tech, and organisational, and work collaboratively to design and evolve a software system to meet those goals. I'm always open to questions so feel free to contact me.
