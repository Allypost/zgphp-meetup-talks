## Description

With the popularization of microservices and distributed systems, containers became a popular choice for creating lightweight and disposable environments that can be easily replicated and distributed. Docker Compose was created to facilitate managing Docker environments that require multiple service containers, such as the typical LEMP stack. 

This talk will demonstrate how to create a PHP development environment with Docker Compose, using a Laravel 7 application as case study. We'll see how to define and integrate services, how to share files between containers, and how to manage your environment with Docker Compose commands.
