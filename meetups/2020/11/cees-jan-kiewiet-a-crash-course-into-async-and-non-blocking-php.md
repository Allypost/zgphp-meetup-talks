## Description

The world of async and non-blocking PHP might be intimidating but let me give you a 
crash course through it's wonderous landscape. From async messaging structures, and 
background queue processors, to non-blocking PHP application services with thread 
workers handling requests. All with real life examples on how they have been done 
and why that way.
