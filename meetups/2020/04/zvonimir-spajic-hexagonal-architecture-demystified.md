# Hexagonal Architecture Demystified

- __Speaker__: Zvonimir Spajic
- __Duration__: 30 min

## Description

When starting to learn Hexagonal Architecture, you can get easily overwhelmed by many of the articles and lectures on the subject, because they often describe a much broader view of the Hexagonal Architecture than the one originally proposed by its author. This view often mixes Hexagonal Architecture with other architectures and approaches like Layered Architecture, CQS, CQRS, etc..

In this talk, we'll get back to the original idea as proposed by Alistair Cockburn but also take a look at how it can be combined with other architectures and why it is so popular among the Domain-Driven Design community.
