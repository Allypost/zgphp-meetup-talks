# Tools and traits to keep your code at level

- __Speaker__: Miro Svrtan
- __Duration__: 35 min

## Description

It's really hard to avoid broken window syndrome when developing: legacy code from ages might not be up to standards of today and often developers use it as excuse when developing new features.

By introducing some code style enforecement tools we can get rid of 'there should be a space there' code reviews, while static analysis tools can help us not only locate some possible bugs in existing code but help us avoid new ones as well.

But it's not all in the toolset, we need to build some traits in our teams to understand the importance of good code quality and keeping it on the level as we go.


## Speaker short bio


Building stuff is a passion of mine: it's not always about code, I try helping businesses build great products and teams. While I'm most often hired as senior developer, I also work as a trainer, helping other developers be better by teaching them new methodologies and sharing my experiences.
