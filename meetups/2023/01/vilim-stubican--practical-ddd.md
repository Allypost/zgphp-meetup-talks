# P(hp)ractical DDD

- **Duration:** 1 hour

## Description

~4 years ago we had an open discussion about Domain Driven Design. 
A lot of great topics were breached and different opinions gave different credits to all presented approaches.

4 years later, I'll try to comprise every bit of experience I got in applying DDD principles in various environments ranging from agency work, corporations, consulting, mentoring to under/overengineering indiviuals.

There were a lot of trials and errors, so let's go through them together and try to extract a conclusion revolving around the DDD hype from the last half of a decade! 

## Speaker short bio

Vilim is a software engineer with an instinctive approach of "Let's do it". He's been developing bugs and faulty software for over a decade and a half now, but only teaching others about how not to do it for the half of that time.

Still a JetBrains IDE Preacher, so God have mercy on those who start a negative discussion around it.
