## Description

OAuth2 is a widely used authorization protocol, and when you get to know it, setting it up in Symfony requires a really short amount of time. But, what happens when you have a requirement to implement custom token claims and to manipulate data that exists solely as a token claim? In this talk, I'll demonstrate how we adapted the official Symfony OAuth2 library to support custom token claims and show the black magic behind manipulating data that lives only in the token.
