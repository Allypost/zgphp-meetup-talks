## Description

We have all encountered the tedious but "dangerous" task of updating the PHP version. 
This is a talk about how we did it on one of our long-term projects where the primary goal was to do the update 
with the highest quality but also as quickly as possible given the upcoming requirements where 
pausing development for a long period was not an option.

Hi everyone, my name is Matej, and I'm a backend dev @undabot. PHP is my primary occupation for the past 4 years,
and I'm always looking forward to learning new stuff about that language.
