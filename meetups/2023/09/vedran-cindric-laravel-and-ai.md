We're going to go through a real life product we built that's using AI and learn how we built it with Laravel, how to finetune a model and how to do streamed responses.

## Speaker short bio
Hi, my name is Vedran, I'm a full-stack-developer and founder of [Treblle](https://treblle.com/). I love building products and writing really optimized and performance focused code. My favorite stack is pure HTML/CSS/JS with a bit of Bootstrap here and there on the front-end side. On the back-end side I've been a life long PHP/MYSQL developer and more recently focused on Laravel and serverless. 

## Requirements
- Internet connection
