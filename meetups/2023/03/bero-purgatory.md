## Description

In a world where cache invalidation is one of the two hardest things developers face,
one company must rise against all odds and face the challenge of always keeping their cache up to date.
Witness as they attempt to solve their problems through various means,
the hardships they face along the way and the knowledge they gain.
Journey with them as they code their way through stale data hell and purge their cache daemons
by creating a simple library that solves all their problems.

Purgatory: The road to invalidation, coming this March at your local PHP meetup.
