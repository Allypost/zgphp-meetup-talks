## Description

"You’re doing "agile" but how many grooming (refinements) do you have, there are still misunderstandings between the tech and non-tech people that you discover as you deliver (causing 
you to do rework)?

How about plugging in some Behaviour Driven development to encourage some true collaboration across roles and bridge that gap of misunderstanding, helping you to build the right 
thing?"".
