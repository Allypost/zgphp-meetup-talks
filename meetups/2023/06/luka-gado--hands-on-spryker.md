## Description

In this presentation we will cover everything you need to know how 
to switch on to Spryker platform and jump start your career.

I will talk about all the difficulties I have encountered 
when I transitioned from a full Symfony framework to Spryker. 
Spryker is a  comprehensive E-commerce solution and it can present certain 
challenges and learning curves.

It's important to understand the key differences and nuances of
the Spryker architecture to leverage its full potential. 
I will also provide you with details on best practices, examples and how to avoid 
falling into the trap of treating Spryker as a traditional Symfony project. 
While it shares some similarities, Spryker has its own concepts, conventions, and infrastructure.
