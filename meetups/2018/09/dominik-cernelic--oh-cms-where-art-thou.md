# Oh CMS, Where Art Thou?

- __Speaker__: Dominik Černelič
- __Duration__: 30 min

## Description

It's the most frowned upon word in web development. For a long time the narrative has been that CMS's are bad, not working, hard and/or limited. If you can use them, they're trash and won't produce results and if they are capable, they're impossible to master for non-hardcores. It's time to change that and to change the word CMS altogether into what it should have meant since the start. A Content Management System, DominoCMS is something completely different and purposely breaks the rules of conventional CMS thinking. It's completely dynamic, lightweight, limitless, lightning fast, frameworkless, sustainable and can be used by total beginners without coding or the hardcore most developers to custom code and develop any kind of website, web application, IT solution or just a pure content management solution. DominoCMS is set to become the Minecraft for adults, your personal sandbox, editor of life and moneymaking machine.


## Speaker short bio

I'm a designer/programmer/brand developer/entrepreneur/..., the founder of Domdesign, digital engineering studio, under which I've been creating design, branding, identity, web and IT solutions for the better part of 2000's. I started creating CMS systems before it was cool and didn't get the memo, so I stayed developing them way after it stopped being cool. My simple motto to endure was "if you do anything for long enough, you'll eventually stop sucking at it". And now my solution DominoCMS is the foundation of my business and has already proved itself in it's many successful business implementations. In the years of searching and development I've learnt so much from free software and now it's time to give it back. Going open source is my way of doing so and the Robin Hood plan is to finally give everyone a chance to make it online and not being forced to use solutions that were created to fail.
