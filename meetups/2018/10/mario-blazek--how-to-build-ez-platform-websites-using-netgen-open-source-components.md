# How to build eZ Platform websites using Netgen open-source components

- __Speaker__: Mario Blažek
- __Duration__: 20 min

## Description

From the early days of Netgen existence, we have been building solutions based on eZ CMS, finding it a supreme base for complex content-driven projects.

Over 15 years of working with eZ, we have – like many other companies – developed a toolbox of smaller and bigger components that we use for most of our projects. The root idea was to build a foundation from which new projects can derive, having all repetitive tasks already preconfigured and set. A lot of these components were open sourced in the process. Now we want to go a step further and offer the whole Netgen eZ stack as an easy-to-use open source skeleton for your next great eZ Platform site!
