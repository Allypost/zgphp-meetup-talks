## Description

Back in the day, developing APIs was a slow, tedious, and mostly manual process. Fast-forward to 2024, and things have changed significantly. With a bit of help from API Platform and AI, I'll show you how API development is done today, including a demo and how to get the documentation for free

## Speaker short bio

Hi, I'm Ante, your standard geek/engineer guy, husband of a way cooler wife and the proud father of two kids with weird names. My hobby, which doubles as a source of income, is software development and infrastructure. This love/hate relationship has been going on for over 15 years now. I spend most of my time automating the "boring" tasks and developing the more interesting ones.
In addition to coding, I hold other titles as well: Barbecue consultant, DevOps wannabe, Home Automation Wife Annoyer, and - equally important - an expert StarTrekWarsWarcraft fan.
