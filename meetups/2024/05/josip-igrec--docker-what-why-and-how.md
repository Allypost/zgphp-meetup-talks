## Description

I bet you've used Docker whether you know it or not. Either by using it as a dev environment,
by pushing to a branch and a preview environment just popping into existence, or by running a random script from StackOverflow.
But have you ever wondered how Docker _actually_ works? And why we're even using it? Or even where it came from?
Well, luck is on your side because today you'll learn what the answers to those questions are.
And you better pay attention because this _will_ be in the quiz.
