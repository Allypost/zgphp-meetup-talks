## Description

PHP changed radically from the first version I used and one of these changes includes long-running or async PHP. RoadRunner is a tool that provides many advantages over classic Apache or Nginx setups. In this talk, I will cover some of these features and go through some caveats with Symfony and PHP that could occur with long-running processes.
