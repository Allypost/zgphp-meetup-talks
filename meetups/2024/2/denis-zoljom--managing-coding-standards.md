## Speaker short bio

Hi! My name is Denis, and I am a business owner/software engineer with 10 years of experience. I'm a big open-source enthusiast, and currently I'm a part of WordPress Coding Standards group. I am a big fan of test driven development, clean architecture, automation, and I love to share my knowledge with others.
When I'm not in front of the computer, you can find me in the gym, hiking or driving my bike (when the weather's nice). Or in the kitchen, baking something delicious.
