## Description
As last year drew to a close, I took a bold leap from my established path in PHP development into the vast world of Kubernetes and application migrations. This talk is a deep dive into my 18-year-long engagement with PHP, reflecting on how it molded my engineering identity and the fresh perspectives I've gained since my departure.

## Speaker short bio
Oh gosh, I haven't done this in awhile...these days, I lead application migrations across huge Kubernetes clusters at [Internet Brands](https://www.internetbrands.com/). I also have strange affinity towards cactuses now. [ðŸŒµ](https://cactus-code.com/)
