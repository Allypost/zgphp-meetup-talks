# My most often repeated reviewer feedback

## Description

In this talk I will demonstrate some of the most common comments I leave when reviewing code from my team.

Instead of nitpicking, I will aim to make the examples relatable and useful by showcasing review comments like:

- "no reason to use metaprogramming here, just hardcode the relevant cases"
- "if you dependency inject the interface, the component will become much easier to test"
- "your `string $foobarType` is obviously some kind of enum, so use an `enum` type for it"
- "client insists that we do X despite our advice, make sure to add a test case so we don't forget why it is there"

The examples will be showcased in a small demo Laravel app, and for each of them I will try to explain the rationale behind the advice - mostly from the perspective of future code maintainability.

Although I expect the talk will be most useful to junior-level developers, my hope is to make it engaging for everyone.

## Speaker short bio

Hi all! My name is Luka and I currently work at [CactusCode](https://cactus-code.com/) as a part-time PHP dev and part-time Laravel instructor,
which means that my daily job largely consists of reviewing code and giving feedback.
Being a late joiner to the PHP world (after 8.0 was released), I never got to experience the "good old days"
and found PHP lovely after coming from previous C++, Python and Go experience.

## Requirements

- Internet connection
