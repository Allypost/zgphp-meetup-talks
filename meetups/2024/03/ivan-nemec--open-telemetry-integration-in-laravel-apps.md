## Speaker short bio

Hello, my name is Ivan. I’m a PHP developer at Q agency for about 2 and a half years now.
My whole work experience which is around 17 years was in IT industry. Firstly in CAD eCatalog solutions, then later on in software development, mostly as a backend developer. In my free time I love to work with power tools and build stuff around the house, just to get a way from the monitors. Also some of my other interests would be bowling and cyclotourism (with beer breaks).
