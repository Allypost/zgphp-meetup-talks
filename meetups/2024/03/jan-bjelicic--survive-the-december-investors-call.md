In this presentation, we will delve into the dynamics of performance reviews and their encompassing elements, with a focus on the often-overlooked non-technical facets. Drawing from my own professional journey, I aim to shed light on the evolving landscape of the IT industry, highlighting the increasing importance of non-coding skills.

Contrary to the stereotypical portrayal of developers secluded in their basements, the reality demands a diverse skill set. Leadership, communication, teamwork, and other soft skills have become indispensable in today's tech ecosystem.
