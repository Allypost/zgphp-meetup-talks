## Description

Remember the famous “5 minutes installation” process for installing WordPress? Let’s see what WP-CLI can do in 5 minutes. And everything else that can happen in the terminal in 40 minutes. We might actually make WordPress more secure. Or just break it.

This is not your usual presentation talk. This is a live terminal commanding; SSHing your WordPress administration and development; and releasing the Kraken or two.
