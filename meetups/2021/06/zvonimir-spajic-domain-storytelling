## Description

Humanity has undergone tremendous changes from the times we were living in caves but one thing stayed the same: we are still very much a storytelling animal. While our ancestors told stories crammed around the fire in their caves, we tell them in bars, at the gym, and at work. They are a powerful vehicle to convey meaning.

So why not use this tool that is so deeply rooted in our evolution when it comes to tackling the old problem of bridging the gap of misunderstanding between the domain experts and the technical people?
