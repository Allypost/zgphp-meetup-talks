## Description


In this talk I explain how to use Xdebug 3 to get more productive writing PHP
code. It is for developers who want to know how to debug their code in a
better way, through single step debugging, profiling, and simpler debugging
tools.

Xdebug is a PHP extension that implements many debugging aids and features. In
this presentation we are going to look at this new version of Xdebug 3. The new
version is a near total rewrite, and brings many improvements over its older
releases. You will learn how to optimally use the new features and settings to
make your development life easier.

Besides introducing the redone functionality, we will also have a cursory look
at how these features are implemented, just to provide a better understanding
of what a debugging extension, can, and cannot do.

You will learn:

- Which features Xdebug 3 has.
- How to debug your application with a single step debugger.
- How to transition from Xdebug 2 to Xdebug 3.
- How some of the things in Xdebug work.
