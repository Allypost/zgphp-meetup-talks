## Description

Symfony Messenger is a powerful tool for queued message handling. That being said,
it is also one of the integral tools we use at Njuškalo to, well, handle our messages.
In this talk I will present the tool itself and how we use it at Njuškalo for daily
operations, as well as how to test these asynchronous jobs themselves.
