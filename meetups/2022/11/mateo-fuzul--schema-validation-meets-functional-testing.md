## Description

You've heard of elf on the shelf, now get ready for schema on the tests. We've all written functional tests in our careers,
but did you know you can validate your schema while doing so? In this talk I will guide you through schema validation testing
using JSON:API standards for schema structure and OpenAPI specification for describing the schema for our validator.

simplest solution. I spend most of my time in the PHP world but like to consider myself technology agnostic.
