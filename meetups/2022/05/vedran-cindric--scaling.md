## Speaker short bio

Hi, my name is Vedran, I'm a full-stack-developer and founder of [Treblle](https://treblle.com/). I love building products and writing really optimized and performance focused code. My favorite stack is pure HTML/CSS/JS with a bit of Bootstrap here and there on the front-end side. On the back-end side I've been a life long PHP/MYSQL developer and more recently focused on Laravel and serverless. 

## Requirements

- A really strong clap for all the slepless nights I had while going through the AWS docs ðŸ˜ƒ
