## Description

Cloud-based infrastructure gets expensive really fast as you scale out. Here at SofaScore, we love to work on high-traffic and performant backend systems, but hate to just throw money around to solve infrastructure hurdles that come with it. That's boring.

I'm going to show you how we operate a bare metal Kubernetes cluster that serves millions of requests each minute, without missing out on typical cloud features such as simple service exposure or distributed data storage.
