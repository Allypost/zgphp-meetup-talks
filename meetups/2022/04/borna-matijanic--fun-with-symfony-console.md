# Fun with symfony console commands

- __Speaker__: Borna Matijanic
  - __Contact__: borna.m@netgen.io, ludwig031 (GitHub)
- __Duration__: 20 min

## Description

This is my very first talk I'm giving at ZgPHP. Driven by desire to bring talks closer to less experienced developers which are sometimes intimidated by advanced topics (as I was when I started attending ZgPHP meetups), I have decided to introduce someone to symfony console commands and show others how they can have fun writing and running them.

I will mostly talk about different approaches of defining commands in symfony, styling, configuring and customizing output. if there is a need, we definitely have to make them, why not have fun while creating and running them?

## Speaker short bio

My name is Borna Matijanic, I'm a PHP/Symfony developer working in netgen for 3 years. I like coding and I love beer, sometimes simultaneously. Planing to allocate to OsPHP :)
