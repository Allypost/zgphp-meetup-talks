# Sans-JS driven development

- __Speaker__: Ivan Habunek
- __Duration__: 25 min

## Description

Today's HTML and CSS have come a long way and offer many oportunities for creating slim pages without tacking on a boatload of Javascript just to create a dropdown menu or a modal.

This talk will demo a couple of lesser known HTML elements and techniques for creating common interactive components.

Hopefully, next time you'll think twice before running `npm install universe` and consider whether your problem is solvable **Sans JS**.

## Speaker short bio

I'm a PHP refugee, currently professionally in the world of Python. I love slim websites, brutalist web design, and dislike sites larger than the collected works of J.R.R. Tolkien.

## Requirements

I'll bring my laptop, but I only need a recent Firefox or Chrome so I can use any machine on hand.
