# Teach'em something!

- __Speaker__: Bla탑 Ora탑em
- __Duration__: 25 min

## Description

One of the most important things in a career of a developer is learning and the way through which an individual learns. 

A person can find passion in a subject that is taught if the teacher can present it well - and more important - he/she can also lose interest if the teacher does not know how to present it. 

That is the reason why we should always pay attention when teaching or mentoring others. 
 
I'll focus on the topic about teaching IT and other content, in terms of who to teach, why and especially how to teach and how to be a mentor. 

## Speaker short bio

My name is Bla탑 Ora탑em, I'm a software developer and CTO at Spletna postaja, an IT company from Ljubljana, which specializes in various web solutions.

I'm also a teacher and a mentor - I'm lecturing at various IT courses and workshops, mainly focusing on web development for beginners.

As a developer I primarily focus on PHP and Laravel development and I like writing clean and readable code. Sometimes I obsess with PSR coding standards :)
