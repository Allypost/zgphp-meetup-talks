# Code Reviews and Git Commit Messages

- __Speaker__: Tomo Šala
- __Duration__: 25 min

## Description

Git Commits introduce changes to the codebases that take time and effort to understand and evaluate. Unless the author provides quality information about the scope of the changes, reasons behind them, and the point and purpose, the commit is almost useless.

I'd like to share with you my experience with git commit messages, pull requests, and code reviews, trying to explain how you can save yourself and other time and effort down the line.
