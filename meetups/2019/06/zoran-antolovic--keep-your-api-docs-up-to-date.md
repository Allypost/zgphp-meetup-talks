# Keep your API docs up-to-date!

- __Speaker__: Zoran Antolovic
- __Duration__: 25 min

## Description

Developing the API from scratch is the most interesting thing one backend developer can imagine IMO. Maintaining and scaling that API for years to come is challenging, kind of repetitive, but still interesting! 

Maintaining the API docs while doing the previous, however, seems like the most complex task for most of the teams I've met and worked with.
Not because it is hard to do, but because it's easy to forget about it and do it wrong, and I'm thinking about how we could make it harder for us?

In this talk, I will show to you my approach on verifying if the API documentation is still in sync with the actual API, if your APIs are lying and making life miserable for your client-side fellow developers, how to add all these things to the CI and how to combine everything by using standards and tools you may, or may not, know about.

## Speaker short bio

I'd like to think about myself as a software engineer deeply involved in the local community. I enjoy exploring and understanding different business domains, creating simple solutions for different challenges, having my peers challenging and questioning my approaches, discussing ideas and concepts, asking questions you'd rather not hear, and constantly finding ways of doing things better.
