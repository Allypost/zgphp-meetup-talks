- __Speaker__: Alen Pokos
- __Duration__: 30 min

## Description

The API design is a topic I find to be interesting and I've learned it is sometimes hard to both development teams producing and consuming the APIs.
I will go over ideas and tricks on how to approach designing web APIs, what to think about and what to watch for, as well as share a lot of my experience and troubles I've seen as best as it can be done in short talk. This is also an introduction into more talks and topics I plan to cover in future meetups.
