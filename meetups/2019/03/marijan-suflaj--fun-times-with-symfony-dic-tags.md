Fun times with Symfony DIC tags

- __Speaker__: Marijan Å uflaj
- __Duration__: 25 min

## Description

Symfony DIC supports tags which are a powerful feature when used with compiler passes. In this talk, my idea is to compare manual container configuration with tagged configuration. Next I'll show some ways to make tagged configuration (perhaps) easier to handle.

For those who want more info, I'll explore parts with word __dynamic__ in the subtitle from the [https://github.com/zlikavac32/symfony-extras](https://github.com/zlikavac32/symfony-extras) repository.

## Speaker short bio

I love hacking, low level things and solving mystical bugs. Although I also work with Java and C, PHP is my primary and best known language with around 11 years of experience with it.
