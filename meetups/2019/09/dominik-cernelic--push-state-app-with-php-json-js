# The pushState app - Goodbye to page refresh

- __Speaker__: Dominik Čerelič
- __Duration__: 30 min

## Description

Remember the good old Flash which allowed you seamless transitions on your website? What if you could do the same with using only PHP, JSON and some javascript? And all while having a full HTML 5 functional website? 
In this talk you will see how to develop a fully dynamic, lightning fast and extremely light web app which doesn't need a page refresh to make things done. 

## Speaker short bio

My name is Dominik Černelič and I develop a web app system using pushState technology. I never really could get over Flash and I wanted to use dynamic content from the database, so the idea of a web app was born.
